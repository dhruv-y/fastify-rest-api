# fastify-rest-api
My attempt at improving my API building abilities using fastify to decrease overhead and improve responsiveness under higher user load. This RESTful API is built using Node.js, MongoDB, Fastify, and Swagger. Medium article (https://medium.com/better-programming/how-to-build-blazing-fast-rest-apis-with-node-js-mongodb-fastify-and-swagger-114e062db0c9) was a great lead and was used as reference through this built.
